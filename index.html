        <p>Hi there I'm Michelle! I have a Bachelor of Design and Indigenous Studies, I got a job working as a UX/UI designer...very quickly realized it was terrible and I made a grave mistake. I packed up from Toronto and moved back home to bancroft where I got a job as a receptionist at a mineral tour place. From here I moved up and became a field geologist assistant which I did for 2 seasonal years. This experience along with my Indigenous studies education I got a student contract with the MNRF which turned into a seasonal contract collecting cultural heritage data. Now I am in this course working my butt off and having a much better time than living in Toronto. <br><br> I focus on storytelling and pushing the limits of traditional design through material exploration. As a designer. I am obsessed with finding or being tasked with a problem and working out how to resolve it in the right way. I work in collaboration with clients to find solutions and to translated concepts into concrete designs. I gather my inspiration from the natural environment around me, creating and crafting experiences through storytelling that are immersed in research from the land and from analog and digital forms. I use design as a platform to explore, build, and map my different relations between this land and dismantling the colonial narratives that were forced onto it. I am focused on building and fostering a great relationship with my clients to create a safe, supportive, and inclusive space to allow for great design and storytelling to flourish.</p>
